# Pole Position
CS232 Final Project. Collaboration with @sawyerstrong. VGA Driver from AntonZero/VGA

We are going to recreate the classic arcade game "Pole Position" using FPGA, writing in VHDL for Altera DE1 Boards. I am later going to update this repository with a more informative document write-up.

[Here is a link to the report for the project. (Work in Progress)](https://www.overleaf.com/read/mbvrzrwfchdx)
