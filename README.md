# THE PTDAMDSWAC
CS232 Final Project. Collaboration with @sawyerstrong. VGA Driver from AntonZero/VGA

We were going to recreate the classic arcade game "Pole Position" using FPGA, writing in VHDL for Altera DE1 Boards. Then, some magic happened, and we ended up with The Pseudo Three Dimensional Ant-Man Driving Simulator With Awesome Coinage.
